# OrlovAnalyzer
is a repository with analyzers I created.


Only 1 is available right now: 
<h1>Simple Yo-Yo Analyzer</h1>

This parser is designed to solve one small problem which is part of the anti-pattern yoyo-problem. 

When you have a large class with many methods, if you don't order them in the order they are called, you will jump up and down when switching between them.

The IDE tells you where you use a method that is defined above its call and can swap between these methods
